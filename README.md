# Data Cleaning Examples - 
 
These are a few examples where I clean the data.
    
    
1. In the project marital status is represented by M and S which means married and Single. it is not good to look into data and hard to understand if any new person looks into that data. So it is changed M and S format to Married and single. 


2. This same thing happens in a gender column where gender is represented with M and F meaning male and female. It is changed in the Male and Female format. 

3. While showing the relationship between age and purchased bike or not data was very messy and on the line chart graph, it is very hard to gain any information from it. So It is transformed into age Groups for example - Young, Middle Age, and old, after that, it was very easy to understand the data on a line chart and convey the message through the charts.
